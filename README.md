# FeriCulator
FeriCulator: A simple Python calculator featuring persistent history and error handling.

Hi! This is my first Python project. It's a simple calculator that saves your calculation history to a local file.

## Features
- **Basic Math**: Supports +, -, *, /, %, //, and ** (power).
- **Square Root**: Calculate `sqrt` of numbers.
- **History**: Automatically saves every calculation to `CalHistory.txt`.
- **History Management**: View your past calculations or clear the history file.
- **Error Handling**: Prevents crashes from invalid inputs or division by zero.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Download `FeriCulator.py`.
3. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python FeriCulator.py
